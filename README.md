# HCA-Project
Welcome to my HCA project! It is currently in progress. This is a project I am working on as an Honors Mentoring Agreement with my mentor, Dr. Brinley Zabriskie. 
The goal of my project is to have a completed presentation and project answering this question: How can patient assistance be improved through better organizing available resources from within a larger healthcare company and available emergency preparedness and disaster relief resources? This is part of a competition project that I am completing on a different time frame for the purpose of developing my skills. I have the freedom to answer this question how I choose, using an employee dataset given to me and any other datasets I can find. 

Included you will find (eventually):
- cleaned code using python (google colab)
- dashboards and visualizations (tableau)
- a finished recommendation and presentation
